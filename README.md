# RethinkDB + Electron = Awesome

### For me RethinkDB and Electron are the most exciting things nowardays.
This is why I thought: Why not combined them together ?  
But this is not so easy. RethinkDB is a not embedded database.  
In this Repo I try to solve this problem. I am still not finished.  

Currently working on:
- Gulp build process

Next:
- Electron-builder integration
- Integration into electron
